# silk:JScode
This tag adds code using JavaScript events in the application. SilkBuilder will collect the code in a JScode component and put it together regardless of where it has been defined.

The code in JScode is executed immediately after being loaded and is usually used to define JavaScript objects.  When this code is executed, Silk Components may not be available or initialized.
